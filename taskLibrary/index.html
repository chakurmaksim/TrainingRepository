                        Libraries play an important part in the cultural development of a country. People have a desire to learn, they seek knowledge. Books satisfy this desire.
                        Books should not be read only for pleasure. Reading books helps us in our education. We can find all kinds of books in the libraries: novels, biographies, fiction, short stories, books on travelling, technical books, magazines, books for children and so on. In some libraries we can find books in many foreign languages.
                        When a reader comes to a library for the first time he fills in his library card and the librarian helps him to choose something to read. The reader is allowed to borrow books for a certain number of days. The catalogues help the reader to find the books he needs. We should be careful with the books and not damage them in any way. We should not make notes in library books or dogs-ear the pages. Reading rooms are open to all who wish to work there. Besides books we can get periodicals, newspaper files and magazines to read there.

                      <p>
                        An adventure is an exciting or unusual experience. It can be risky, exhilarating, bold and exuberant. It can include; sky diving, travelling or extreme sports. But that was just a list of some outdoorsy activities. However, adventure can include indulging in a thrilling movie, writing an exciting story or simply, reading an adventure book. For me, that’s the greatest venture of all, where I can let my imagination run wild and let the book lead me into a world of hazards, endangerment and uncertainty. Therefore if you classify yourself as a bohemian, wanderer, risk-taking adventurer, I dare you to go ahead and read these top ten adventure books of all time.
